# Kaggle-Titanic-challenge
Titanic challenge on Kaggle is a competition in which we have to predict the survival or the death of a given passenger based on a set of variables describing him such as his age, his sex, or his passenger class on the boat.  I have done Data cleaning, Normalisation, and build a logistic regression model to predict the same.
